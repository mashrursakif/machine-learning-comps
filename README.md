# Machine Learning Competition Solutions

I'm a student working on machine learning and data science projects. This is a collection of solutions to machine learning competitions I've participated in. They include competitions from [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), [CrunchDAO](https://hub.crunchdao.com/competitions), etc. These solutions are available as Jupyter Notebooks or as Python scripts.
